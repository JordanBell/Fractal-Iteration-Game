Subject: Encrypted Emails

Hey there,

Some emails are encrpyted. 

Don't shy away though! These ones have the juiciest information in them. 

Anything worth hiding is totally worth reading.

Want to hear my darkest secret?

My favorite food. 

It's blueberries. 

Weird right? 

I mean, technically they're purple, but what are you gonna do. 

How could I love a food so paradoxical? 

You could say I like to live life on the wild side.
