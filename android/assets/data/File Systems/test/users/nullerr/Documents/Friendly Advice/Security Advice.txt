Hello.

There are lots of different types of security.

Some places are encrypted, while others are password protected.

You can use VirgoExploiter.exe on encrypted files and folders.

Others may require a password.

Other places may have security measures layered over one other.

There are lots of different security measures. But remember: the stronger the security, the more interesting the contents.

Let your curiosity guide you! Always search for a way in.
