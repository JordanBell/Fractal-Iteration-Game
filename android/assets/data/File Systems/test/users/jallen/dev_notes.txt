Jack Allen, or "Jackal" is one of two senior researchers. He is more amoral than the other, and dreams big. Cares more about his own research than anyone else. Wants to be remember. He sees how Dean will do anything to please the other developers, and manipulates him to try something great. Dean presents several ideas, but they are far to tame for Jackal's tastes.

Jackal entered into his role with an almost psychotic motive. He desired to push AI to its fullest extents. When he was young, Jackal was more than simply ignorant of the dangers of morally neutral AI. He heard the fearmongering of emotionless, logical AI, and is sadistically seduced by making the prospect a reality.

In one of his earlier logs, he notes how one he overheard a researcher getting tired of the media fearmongering AI. The researcher states that AI can be controlled, and there is nothing to fear from a so called "robot apocalypse". Jackal, however, acknowledges the fact that this is impossible if the AI are not designed that way. If the AI are not designed that way.

Jackal struggles with his sadistic nature. He can't stop the thoughts exploring the concept of a malicious AI. He talks about how his mind gets away from him; how it theorizes that, while a goal-driven, amoral AI can be avoided, it can also be designed. But in order for it to pass the company's standards, its virtues must outweigh its sins. His thoughts tell him that he must minimise the life-disregarding nature, and maximise its pay-offs. Razzle dazzle the higher-ups. Fool the ones who know better.

Back to "current day", Jackal's own experiments have been fruitless. Every attempt at creating a completely goal-driven, "perfect" AI has been foiled by his senior counterpart; his partner, the other "good" researcher. He sees the brilliance of Dean, and his eagerness to please. He knows that, if he can use that to his advantage, the "perfect" AI could be created, unhindered. And, if things go wrong, Dean will take the fall.
